[Book-IT GmbH](https://book-it.de) is a family run hospitality business located in the beautiful franconian Erlangen. With more than 200 apartments for rent, and a strong utilisation rate due to the very strong economical region, they always have plenty of things to do - thus their internal management platform was born.

At New Thread we have developed a variety of deep integrations into their existing system landscape, deployed hardware, replaced legacy systems, and written an own management progressive web application that allows the team at Book IT to get the job done at no compromise.
