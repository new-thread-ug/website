Our team is part of the core contributors to Open Nexus.
A open source logistics technology stack that enables any logistics company to run and operate.
It consists of:

- Core Data
- Mapping Solutions
- Communication and Collaboration
- Track & Trace Integrations
- Integration suite

Open Nexus is in his very early stages, and we are excited to bring fresh air to the industry by building out in the open.
This is in parts made possible by the strong backing of [Joseph Carnarius](https://freightforce.one) and other partners of the industry.
If you have any questions, or want to contribute, please do not hesitate reaching out to us via [E-Mail](mailto:max@new-thread.de)
