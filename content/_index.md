`New Thread UG (Haftungsbeschraenkt)` is a privately held `research, software development and consulting` company located in the heart of `Berlin, Germany`. 

A `thread` in computer science is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler, which is typically a part of the operating system. In many cases, a thread is a component of a process.

In other words, a thread can be looked at as a piece of code, as small as possible, that can be executed - hopfully concurrently to speed things up.

We deliver such `precise sets of instructions` and develop `technological solutions` with a keen eye for `detail, performance, and excellence`.
